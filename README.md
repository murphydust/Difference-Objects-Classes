# Difference-Objects-Classes

A class is a blueprint or template for something you want to model in a program. It defines what data (fields) the thing has and what it can do (methods). A class is not a “real thing” by itself, it is more like a plan.
An object is an actual instance created from that blueprint. When you use new, you take the class design and build a real thing in memory. Objects have their own real values stored inside them. That means you can create multiple objects from the same class, and each object can hold different data, even though they all follow the same structure.
Conceptual difference:
•	A class answers: “What is this type supposed to look like and do?”
•	An object answers: “What is one real example of that type right now, with its own values?”

# Difference-Objects-Classes

A class is a blueprint or template for something you want to represent in a program. When you create a class, you are not creating a real object yet. Instead, you are describing what that type of thing should look like and what it should be able to do. A class defines the data it will store using fields and the actions it can perform using methods. On its own, a class does not take up space as a usable object in memory. It exists to give Java instructions on how to create objects later.
An object is an actual instance created from that class blueprint. When you use the keyword “new”, Java takes the class definition and builds a real object in memory. This object stores real values and can actively use the methods defined in the class. Objects are what the program actually works with while it is running. You can interact with them, change their data, and call their methods.
One important thing to understand is that you can create many objects from the same class. Even though all of those objects follow the same structure and rules defined by the class, each object stores its own values. This means changing data in one object does not affect the others. For example, two objects created from the same class can have different names, IDs, or other values, even though they use the same fields and methods.
Conceptually, the difference comes down to definition versus reality. A class answers the question of what a type is supposed to look like and what it can do. It is the design or plan. An object answers the question of what one real example of that type looks like at a specific moment while the program is running. The class provides the structure, while the object represents a real, usable instance with its own unique state.
